= Inspirations / Influences
FTL 
- Classic roguelite
- Tree based navigation
- planning ahead required, can be very punishing for a small mistake
This War of Mine
- 2D Exporation hallways
Dead Space
- Dark, and brutal

Travel from ship to ship (in a choice-based tree map)
Need to escape the ship before oxygen runs out; or game over
Energy resupplies BOTH oxygen and laser shots



Laser shots are expensive, but powerful
blowback from laser, battery pickups for energy extension, flashlight isn't always needed (drains extra power)
